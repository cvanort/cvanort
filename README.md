My name is Caitlin Van Ort and I work as a data scientist in the gaming industry. Prior to that, I worked as a data scientist in financial regulation for 12 years. In my personal time, I focus on projects outside of these sectors and am particularly interested in human empowerment and prisoner rights.</br></br>
